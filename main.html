       <h2>About Me</h2>
	   <p> My name is Andrew Breaux and I am a junior at Regis University. I am a <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> Major with a possible minor in mathmatics.</p> 
       <p>Taking computer science classes helps especially if you want to add mathematical equations to a
       website such as<br><font color="red">x<sup>2</sup>+10=y</font>  <br> It also helps with chemical formulas for compounds such as
       sulphate<br><font color="blue">SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></font><br>
